# PowerCommander
Intelligent fire alarm control host program based on VB.NET for Windows NT systems
*IMPORTANT NOTICE: The PowerCommander, PowerMarshall and System Extender systems are NOT listed fire alarm devices and are intended solely for use in education, demonstration and hobby circumstances where preexisting, sifficient fire protection is in place.*

## Features
- **Fire alarm:** 10 fire alarm zones built into the control panel, and the possibility for up to 16 additional zones (4 per System Extender)
- **Hazard alarm:** 4 hazard alarm zones built into the control panel, and the possibility for up to 8 additional zones (2 per System Extender) - Manage alarm situations which aren't related to a fire (such as extreme weather, carbon monoxide, network equipment fault, etc.)
- **Audible silence:** Silence fire alarm audible signals during an alarm situation, but leave the visual signals (strobe lights) flashing until the system is reset or the system is unsilenced
- **Dynamically extend the protection areas:** The use of System Extender units enables up to four semi-remote slave systems to operate over a network such as a wired LAN or WAN, managing all activities from the central master unit

## Uses
 - **Demonstration system:** PowerCommander is small and customizable, making it ideal for testing and demonstration systems, as well as for demonstration of [electronically controlled fire suppression systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1Apl4yX9lc)
 - **Education and hobby situations:** PowerCommander is versatile and customizable, making it ideal for use in hobby systems and for system education. It is possible to utilize PowerCommander in a home by distributing System Extenders into desired areas. The system will be interconnected solely by a preexisting 10/100 or Gigabit ethernet backbone, eliminating the need for messy cabling through undesired areas.
